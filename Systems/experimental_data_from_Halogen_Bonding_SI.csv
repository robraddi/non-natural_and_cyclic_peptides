NOE-buildup analysis,,,,,
NOESY spectra were recorded on a 900 MHz BRUKER Avance III HD NMR spectrometer,,,,,
equipped with a TCI cryoprobe. NOE build-ups were recorded without solvent suppression,,,,,
"with mixing times of 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600 and 700 ms. The relaxation delay was set",,,,,
"to 2.5 s, and 16 scans were recorded with 16384 points in the direct dimension and 512 points",,,,,
in the indirect dimension. Distances were calculated using geminal methylene protons (1.78,,,,,
Å) as reference. The NOE peak intensities were calculated using normalization of both cross,,,,,
peaks and diagonal peaks according to ([cross peak1 × cross peak2 ]/[diagonal peak1 × diagonal,,,,,
peak2 ]) 0.5. At least 5 mixing times giving a linear (r2 >0.98) initial NOE rate for every distance,,,,,
were used to determine σ ij build-up rates (Figures S2–S6) according to the equation,,,,,
"r ij=r ref (σ ref /σ ij) (1/6), where r ij is the distance between protons i and j in Ångström and σ ij is the",,,,,
normalized intensity obtained from NOESY experiments. The calculated distances are given,,,,,
in Tables S9-S13.,,,,,

4. Computational conformational analysis,,,,,,,,,
Conformational searches were performed using the Monte Carlo algorithm with intermediate,,,,,,,,,
"torsion sampling, 50000 Monte Carlo steps, and RMSD cut-off set to 2.0 Å, followed by",,,,,,,,,
Molecular Mechanics energy minimization with the software Macromodel (v.9.1) as,,,,,,,,,
"implemented in the Schrödinger package. For 3a-b and 4 a-b, two independent searches were",,,,,,,,,
"performed using OPLS-2005 or Amber* as force field, and with water solvation model. The",,,,,,,,,
"conformational search for peptide 5 and 8 was also performed with the force field OPLS-38 , a",,,,,,,,,
new version of OPLS with parameters for aromatic halogen bonding included. Energy,,,,,,,,,
minimization was performed using the Polak-Ribiere type conjugate gradient (PRCG) with,,,,,,,,,
maximum iteration steps set to 5000. All conformations within 42 kJ/mol from the global,,,,,,,,,
minimum were saved. The ensembles from the conformational searches using the different,,,,,,,,,
force fields were combined and elimination of redundant conformtions was preformed by the,,,,,,,,,
comparsion of heavy atom coordinates applying a RMSD cutoff of 2.5 Å for the cyclic,,,,,,,,,
"peptides and 3.0 Å for the linear ones, giving the ensembles used in NAMFIS. The results are",,,,,,,,,
summarized in Table S20. Since the force fields used do not include parameters for aliphatic,,,,,,,,,
"halogen bonds, no conformations with halogen bonding interaction were obtained from the",,,,,,,,,
"conformational analyses of peptide 5 and 8. Therefore, a hairpin conformer was minimized",,,,,,,,,
with constrained Cl/Br-OMe distances and angles and these conformers were then added to,,,,,,,,,
the corresponding ensemble. The constrains used to generate these conformers were: Cl-OMe,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,S26,,

"distance 2.94 Å +/ 10% (corresponding to 90% of the sum of the van der Waals radie), Br-",,,,
"OMe distance 3.03 Å +/ 10% (corresponding to 90% of the sum of the van der Waals radie),",,,,
C-Cl-O(Me) angle (180° +/ 10%) and C-Br-O(Me) angle (180° +/ 10%).,,,,

deviation cutoff 2.5 Å (cyclic peptides) and 3.0 Å (linear peptides) for heavy atoms. This conformation ensemble,,,,
is used as input in the NAMFIS analysis. To the ensembles of 5 and 8 a halogen bond constrained peptide was,,,,
"added, see text for details.",,,,
5. Identification of solution ensemble using the NAMFIS algorithm,,,,
Solution ensembles were determined by fitting the experimentally measured distances and,,,,
coupling constants to those back-calculated for computationally predicted conformations,,,,
following previously described protocols.9 Dihedral angles were calculated from experimental,,,,
"coupling constants using a Karplus equation specifically developed for peptides.10,11NOE-",,,,
"derived distances are presented in Tables S9–S13, whereas coupling constants are presented",,,,
in Table S8. The results of the NAMFIS-analysis are given in Table S21. Since the side chain,,,,
orientations are poorly predicted by the conformational searches only back bone interactions,,,,
"were included in the NAMFIS analyses, with the exception of the highly flexible linear",,,,
peptides where some side chain positions had to be included in order to get enough data to,,,,
"perform the analysis. The ensemble analyses were validated using standard methods, that is,",,,,
S27,,,,

through evaluation of the reliability of the conformational restraints by the addition of 10%,,,,,,,,,
"random noise to the experimental data, by the random removal of individual restraints, and by",,,,,,,,,
comparison of the experimentally observed and back-calculated distances and scalar coupling,,,,,,,,,
constants.,,,,,,,,,
